# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use git to store content, maintain a history of changes to our code, and push our code to a source control.
    
02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Make Directory which is creating a new file

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > we add pseudo-classes to a selector to give it special characteristics. I think link and hover will be used commonly.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity decides which rule should be applied to an element based on a point system associated with different selectors.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Using the !important feature overrides the specificity which could cause confusion in certain scenarios.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    >  Selector (h1), property (color), value (value of said color)

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Website design reflects on the company. If a website is broken or unappealing to look at, customers will be less likely to interact with it. A good website design can convey to a customer exactly what your company does and give them confidence in your product or service.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframing is important in providing a template for the project you're working on so you have a detailed blueprint to work off of instead of just winging it.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Probably not when it comes to very simple projects, but absolutely when it comes to larger projects. It helps to have a rough visual outline to go off of instead of just deciding as you go.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > the flex property establishes how child elements will be displayed into columns or rows.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > height and width, as well as things like border, margin, and padding.
