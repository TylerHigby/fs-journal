# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > synchronous code runs from top to bottom in order where asynchronous code runs later on, depending on when u want it to.

02. What is an event listener?

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > A promise is an object with 3 possible states(pending, resolved, rejected). Similar to callbacks with a few differences. We capture errors from promises using .catch

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > get, post, put

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > application programming interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > it must be an async 

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > Its a mechanism of storing data members and data methods of a class together. it helps with security by hiding data members and functions.

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?
